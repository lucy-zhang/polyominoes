# polyominoes

Implementation of [Redelmeier's algorithm for enumerating fixed polyominoes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X81902375), plus some very slow code to enumerate free polyominoes by explicitly checking symmetries.

Maybe someday I'll get around to implementing the fast algorithm for enumerating free polyominoes.
